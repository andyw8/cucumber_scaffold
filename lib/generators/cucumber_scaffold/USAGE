Description:
    Scaffolding for Cucumber features

Example:

  For first time use:

    rails generate cucumber_scaffold_install

    This will create:
        features/shared/web_steps_additional.rb

  Then for a feature:

    rails generate cucumber_scaffold_feature Post title:string body:text

    This will create:
        features/manage_posts.rb
        features/step_definitions/post_steps.rb

    and will modify:
        features/support/paths.rb

Options:

    --nifty

    --tags
    Include Cucumbers @tags matching each scenario to one or more controller actions
